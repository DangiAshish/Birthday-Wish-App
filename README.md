Hi, 
Thanks for visit ðŸ˜Š
here is the complete source code of a Birthday Wish Android App designed and developed in Android Studio.

<b>How to customise this</b> :
Take at least 14 different Pictures or selfies of yourself or someone else and put their name in alphabetical order like (a, b, c..... n) and then replace your picture collection with the project drawables.
